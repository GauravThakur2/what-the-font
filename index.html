            <h2>Home for the Holidays - Lyrics</h2>
            <p>
                Oh, <span class="highlight1">there's no place</span> like home for the holidays <br>
                'Cause no matter how far away you roam <br>
                When you pine for the sunshine of a <span class="highlight2">friendly</span> gaze <br>
                For the <span class="highlight3">holidays</span> you can't beat home, sweet home <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="highlight1">I met a man who lives in Tennessee</span> <br>
                And he was headin' for <br>
                Pennsylvania and some homemade pumpkin pie <br>
                From Pennsylvania folks are trav'lin' down <br>
                To Dixie's <span class="highlight3">sunny shore</span> <br>
                From Atlantic to Pacific, gee, <br>
                <span class="highlight1">The traffic is terrific!</span> <br>
                
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh, there's <span class="highlight1">no place like home</span> for the holidays <br>
                'Cause no matter how far away you roam <br>
                If you want to be <span class="highlight1">happy</span> in a million ways <br>
                For the holidays you can't beat home, sweet home <br>
            </p>
